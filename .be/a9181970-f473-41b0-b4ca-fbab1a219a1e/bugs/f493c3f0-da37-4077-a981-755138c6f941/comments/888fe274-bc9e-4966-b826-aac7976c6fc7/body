If the object repository path is deleted while the server is running,
ther server will throw an exception at access-time, not doing any
checks before-hand.

The current behaviour of the server is to die with an
exception. Perhaps it would be more graceful to try and restore the
object path, perhaps with some log.error telling that the server has
lost its storage data?
